Sgoettschkes/openshift-apache2.4
============================

This is a sample repository to get apache 2.4 running on openshift. It's a 
work in progress!

More information about this project: tbd

What's inside
-------------

The misc/install.sh script installs:

* Apache 2.4.3

It configures apache to have the diy folder as the document root.

The script does not remove the source files, so you can easily recompile 
Apache. Have a look at the shell script to see with which options
both were compiled the first time.

The misc/httpconf.py script takes the httpd.conf from misc/templates and
replaces some variables with the actual folder pathes (because these 
depend on the application, they cannot be hardcoded). It then copies
the file into the apache conf folder.

Usage
-----

To get Apache 2.4 working at OpenShift, you have to do the following:

1. Create a new Openshift "Do-It-Yourself" application
2. Clone this repository
3. Add a new remote "openshift" (You can find the URL to your git repository
   on the Openshift application page)
4. Run `git push --force "openshift" master:master`
5. SSH into your gear
6. `nohup $OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR/misc/install.sh > $OPENSHIFT_DIY_LOG_DIR/install.log`
7. Wait (This may take at least an hour)
8. You can remove the misc content
